# Build and Test Status (2025-10-25)

## Environment Initialization
- Command: `make initialize`
- Result: Failed because the `libft` submodule references commit `bdc5b49bd55e333e8575c87a3796acfc59d9f66f`, which no longer exists on the remote. Git aborts with `upload-pack: not our ref`.

## Build
- Command: `make all`
- Result: Fails during the libft setup stage for the same reason. The build cannot proceed without the missing submodule commit.

## Tests
- Command: `make test`
- Result: Fails for the same missing commit in the libft submodule. Tests cannot run without a successful submodule checkout and build.

## Next Steps
- Restore the `bdc5b49bd55e333e8575c87a3796acfc59d9f66f` commit (or update the submodule pointer to an available revision) in https://github.com/Adyem/Libft.git.
- Re-run `make initialize`, followed by `make all` and `make test` once the submodule is fixed.
