# COBOL Sample Inventory

This catalog enumerates the COBOL fixtures that drive validation of the reverse pipeline. Most programs live in
`samples/cobol` and are registered in `samples/cobol/manifest.txt` so automated checks can keep the documentation and
filesystem synchronized. The quick-start example pairs its COBOL artifact with the accompanying makefile in
`samples/example_project` so the entire demo fits inside a single directory.

## Sample Coverage

### `samples/cobol/minimal_program.cob`
- **Purpose:** Supplies a compact program that exercises the parser and reverse emitter without relying on file I/O constructs.

  loop with `AT END` handling.

### `samples/cobol/filter_prefix.cob`
- **Purpose:** Demonstrates record filtering with substring comparisons to exercise conditional evaluation over COBOL
  structures.
- **Constructs:** Group level records, substring `IF` comparisons, iterative `READ` logic, and conditional `WRITE`
  statements.

  layouts.

  in WORKING-STORAGE.

### `samples/cobol/reverse_constructs.cob`
- **Purpose:** Drives the COBOLâ†’CBL-C reverse emitter against the constructs it currently recovers so we can enforce the output
  shape with golden fixtures.

  blocks, `WRITE ... FROM` output, and `MOVE` statements updating sentinel flags.

### `samples/cobol/reverse_normalization.cob`
- **Purpose:** Exercises identifier, literal, and layout normalization paths so the reverse emitter can produce idiomatic CBL-C
  even from loosely formatted COBOL.
- **Constructs:** Hyphenated identifiers, lowercase working-storage names that normalize into flag/numeric/buffer declarations,
  string literals with mixed casing, numeric literals that include leading zeros, multiple procedure paragraphs, and STOP
  statements.

### `samples/cobol/reverse_control_flow.cob`
- **Purpose:** Expands the reverse fixtures with combined conditional branches and looping constructs so complex control flow
  sequencing stays stable under round-trip testing.
- **Constructs:** Level-01 flag and counter storage, `IF NOT` conditionals, `PERFORM UNTIL` loops that update sentinel values
  through `MOVE`, `PERFORM VARYING` counters, sequential `MOVE` assignments, numeric `DISPLAY` output, and STOP statements
  spread across multiple procedure paragraphs.

### `samples/cobol/reverse_numeric_scalars.cob`
- **Purpose:** Introduces decimal WORKING-STORAGE items and additional boolean suffixes so the reverse emitter can recover
  floating-point variables and broaden flag detection beyond `-FLAG`.

  `-IND`, literal `MOVE` statements, and `STOP RUN` termination.

  `float`, and `double` declarations.
- **Constructs:** Level-01 `PIC S9(12)` and `PIC S9(19)` items with matching assignments, literal `MOVE` statements that drive
  widened integer and floating declarations, and a terminating `STOP RUN.` paragraph.

  declaration and mirrored scalars in the generated CBL-C.
- **Constructs:** A group containing alphanumeric and decimal children, a separate status byte with a VALUE default, literal
  `MOVE` statements targeting the group members, and a closing `STOP RUN.` paragraph.

### `samples/cobol/reverse_value_defaults.cob`
- **Purpose:** Exercises VALUE clauses on supported scalars so the reverse emitter can recover default-initialized booleans,
  numerics, and text buffers directly into CBL-C.
- **Constructs:** Level-01 flag, integer, and decimal items with VALUE defaults, an alphanumeric buffer populated through a
  literal VALUE clause, and a bare `STOP RUN` procedure that leaves the recovered storage untouched.

### `samples/cobol/reverse_string_length_metadata.cob`

  reverse pipeline can honor the recorded caller length when regenerating CBL-C declarations.
- **Constructs:** Level-01 alphanumeric item with a `PIC X(5)` clause, literal `MOVE` into the buffer, and a terminating `STOP
  RUN.` paragraph.

### `samples/cobol/reverse_copybook.cob`
- **Purpose:** Extends the reverse fixtures with a `COPY` directive and character heuristics so shared working-storage and
  single-byte codes translate into the right CBL-C surface area.
- **Constructs:** Simple `COPY` include resolved through the registered copybook table, a single-character code that remains a
  scalar, buffer identifiers that keep their array form, and a minimal `STOP RUN` procedure body.

### `samples/cobol/reverse_comments.cob`
- **Purpose:** Verifies that inline `*>` comments in WORKING-STORAGE and PROCEDURE DIVISION survive lexing so the reverse
  pipeline can re-emit them near the reconstructed statements.
- **Constructs:** Consecutive comment lines annotating level-01 declarations, inline trailing comments after `MOVE`
  statements, paragraph header notes, and straightforward `DISPLAY`/`STOP RUN` control flow that keeps the focus on comment
  preservation.

  the regenerated CBL-C at the correct indentation level.
- **Constructs:** 77-level boolean declarations with defaults, inline `MOVE` commentary, conditional `IF` blocks containing
  annotated statements, and paragraph transitions that include remarks between routines.

### `samples/cobol/reverse_comment_inline_control.cob`
- **Purpose:** Verifies that inline remarks placed immediately before COBOL statements survive translation when they appear ahead of control flow constructs.

  and populate a trailing return slot.
- **Constructs:** `CALL` statements with `USING BY REFERENCE` arguments, subprogram definitions with `LINKAGE SECTION`
  parameters, arithmetic implemented through `COMPUTE`, and `GOBACK` exits for the invoked routine.

  state updates.
- **Constructs:** Multi-argument `CALL` sequences, remainder-driven `DIVIDE` operations, conditional `MOVE` assignments that set
  flag bytes, and subprogram linkages that mirror the return buffer contract.

### `samples/cobol/return_character.cob`
- **Purpose:** Provides a character-oriented example where the subprogram writes to the trailing buffer so callers can reuse
  their own storage for results.
- **Constructs:** Single-argument `CALL` statements, working-storage defaults that seed returned values, linkage section buffer
  declarations, and `MOVE` statements that copy data into the supplied return slot.

### `samples/cobol/multi_module_main.cob`

## Maintenance Checklist

1. Add a new `.cob` file under `samples/cobol` when introducing COBOL-side language features that need sample coverage.
2. Append the file path to `samples/cobol/manifest.txt` so tooling and tests can locate the new example.
3. Update this document with a short description and construct summary so downstream contributors understand what the sample is
   intended to cover.
