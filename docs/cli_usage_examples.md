# CLI Usage Examples

The `ctoc_cobol_transpiler` binary provides a single entry point for converting between CBL-C and COBOL source files. This guide collects ready-to-run invocations that illustrate the required flags, optional formatting controls, and diagnostics knobs exercised by the command-line interface.

## Required options

Every run must specify the transformation direction alongside at least one input and output path:

```
ctoc_cobol_transpiler --direction cblc-to-cobol --input samples/cblc/copy_file.cblc --output build/copy_file.cob
```

* `--direction` accepts `cblc-to-cobol` or `cobol-to-cblc` and determines which frontend/parser and backend/emitter pair the pipeline assembles.
* `--input` points at the source file that the pipeline reads. Repeat the flag to queue additional translation units.
* `--output` names the artifact written by the code generator. Provide one `--output` per input so the files can be emitted side by side.

When converting several modules in a single invocation, pair each input with a matching output in the order they appear:

```
ctoc_cobol_transpiler --direction cblc-to-cobol \
  --input src/records.cblc --output build/records.cob \
  --input src/formatters.cblc --output build/formatters.cob
```

The tool rejects mismatched counts to ensure every generated COBOL file has a designated destination.

## Optional layout and destination controls

```
ctoc_cobol_transpiler --direction cobol-to-cblc --input samples/cobol/copy_file.cob --output build/copy_file.cblc --output-dir dist --format pretty
```

* `--output-dir` overrides the directory that hosts generated files. When omitted, the tool writes next to the provided `--output` path.
* `--format` accepts `default`, `minimal`, or `pretty` to toggle whitespace and alignment policies in emitted COBOL.

## Diagnostics and help

```
ctoc_cobol_transpiler --direction cblc-to-cobol --input input.cblc --output output.cob --diagnostics verbose
```

* `--diagnostics` switches the verbosity tier: `silent` hides non-fatal notes, `normal` shows errors and warnings, and `verbose` streams per-stage logging.
* `--help` prints a summary of options and exits successfully without running the pipeline.

## Environment variable shortcut

The `CTOC_DEFAULT_DIRECTION` environment variable supplies a fallback value for `--direction`. When exported, the flag becomes optional:

```
export CTOC_DEFAULT_DIRECTION=cblc-to-cobol
ctoc_cobol_transpiler --input samples/cblc/record_writer.cblc --output build/record_writer.cob
```

Unset or change the variable to swap the default compilation direction.

## End-to-end sample workflow

1. Choose a staging directory for generated files:
   ```
   mkdir -p build
   ```
2. Transpile the sample program while enabling verbose diagnostics:
   ```
   ctoc_cobol_transpiler --direction cblc-to-cobol --input samples/cblc/filter_prefix.cblc --output build/filter_prefix.cob --diagnostics verbose
   ```
3. Inspect the resulting COBOL file and review the emitted diagnostics to confirm the pipeline completed successfully.
